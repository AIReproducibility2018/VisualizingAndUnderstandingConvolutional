This is a reproduction attempt for the paper "Visualizing and understanding convolutional networks" [1].

The 'Code' folder contains the experiment code run in the reproduction attempts.

**Note:** This reproduction attempt failed because we were unable to run the code to compleation and produce results with the available hardware in the alloted time. As such no results are available.
